# Data Science Materials

I am a teaching assistant of DS100 in Fall 2018 at UC Berkeley. Here are assignments including projects, homework and labs. In order to give students a satsfactory answer, I finished them independently before I go to the lab, discussion and office hour.

The original material is in the [official course website](https://github.com/DS-100/fa18).
