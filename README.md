I am an academic intern of DS100 in Fall 2018 at UC Berkeley who assists professors and GSIs solve students' questions during office hours and labs. Here are some assignments including projects, homework and labs. To give students a satisfactory answer, I finish them independently before I go to the lab and office hour.

The original material is in the [official course website](https://github.com/DS-100/fa18).
