    "# Homework 2: Bike Sharing\n",
    "## EDA and Visualization\n",
    "## Due Date: Tuesday 9/25, 11:59 PM\n",
    "## Course Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important course policies. These are also located at\n",
    "http://www.ds100.org/fa18/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about\n",
    "the homework, we ask that you **write your solutions individually**. If you do\n",
    "discuss the assignments with others please **include their names** at the top\n",
    "of your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment includes both specific tasks to perform and open-ended questions to investigate. The open-ended questions ask you to think creatively and critically about how the plots you have created provide insight into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reading plaintext delimited data into `pandas`\n",
    "* wrangling data for analysis\n",
    "* using EDA to learn about your data \n",
    "* making informative plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "Grading is broken down into autograded answers and free response. \n",
    "\n",
    "For autograded answers, the results of your code are compared to public and/or hidden tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For free response, readers will evaluate how well you answered the question and/or fulfilled the requirements of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plots, your plots should be *similar* to the given examples. We will tolerate small variations such as color differences or slight variations in scale. However it is in your best interest to make the plots as similar as possible as similarity is subject to the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that for ALL plotting questions from here on out, we will expect appropriate titles, axis labels, legends, etc. The following question serves as a good guideline on what is \"enough\": If I directly downloaded the plot and viewed it, would I be able to tell what was being visualized without knowing the question?** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission - IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ\n",
    "For this assignment and future assignments (homework and projects) you will also submit your free response and plotting questions to gradescope. To do this, you can download as PDF (`File->Download As->PDF via Latex (.pdf)`). You are responsible for submitting and tagging your answers in gradescope. For each free response and plotting question, please include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relevant code used to generate the plot or inform your insights\n",
    "2. The written free response or plot\n",
    "\n",
    "We are doing this to make it easier on our graders and for you, in the case you need to submit a regrade request. Gradescope (as of now) is still better for manual grading.\n",

If you use the capability to do different aggregations by column, you can do this task with a single call to `groupby` and `agg`. For the `workingday` column we can take any of the values since we are grouping by the day, thus the value will be the same within each group.
